## Creating installer for Windows

We are using [Inno setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/) for creating installer for windows

If you are packaging on Linux , you want to install [wine](http://wiki.winehq.org/FrontPage) first.

However it is recommended to build and pack windows installer on same Windows operating system.

## TODO
* Write more instructions about this process
* Use [winresourcer](https://github.com/felicienfrancois/node-winresourcer) to modify exe property
* Use [enigma](http://enigmaprotector.in/en/aboutvb.html) virtual box to pack exe
